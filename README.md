# Laravel Module Generator

A Laravel package to quickly generate modular components such as Controllers, Models, Views, Repositories, and Services. This package helps in creating a modular structure in Laravel applications, making the code more organized and manageable.

## Features

- Create directories for Controllers, Models, Requests, Routes, Views, Migrations, Tests, Providers, Repositories, and Services.
- Generate Service Providers, Controllers, Views, Routes, Repositories, and Services files with basic templates.
- Automatically register the Service Provider in `config/app.php`.
- Automatically include module routes in `routes/web.php`.
- Update `helpers.php` file to include `module_path` function.

## Installation

1. **Install the package via Composer:**

   ```bash
   composer require khaledneam/module-generator dev-main --dev
   ```
2. Update composer.json
```bash
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Modules\\": "Modules/"
        }
    },
    "files": [
        "app/helpers.php"
    ]
}


```
Then, update Composerâ€™s autoload files:
```bash
composer dump-autoload

```




Usage
To create a new module, use the following Artisan command:
```bash
php artisan make:module ModuleName
```

Example
```bash
php artisan make:module Blog
```
This will create a new module named Blog with the following structure:
```php

Modules/
    Blog/
        Controllers/
        Models/
        Requests/
        Routes/
        Views/
        Migrations/
        Tests/
        Providers/
        Repositories/
        Services/
```
